# chameleon-chess-ai

This project implements a computer player for the board game chameleon chess. The player should become part of the game logic package, which can be found here: https://github.com/hd-code/chameleon-chess-logic/

An explanation of the game and its rules can be found in the logic repository as well.

**This is also my bachelor thesis!**
